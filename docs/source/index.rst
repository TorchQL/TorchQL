TorchQL Documentation
========================================

**TorchQL** is a framework for programming integrity constraints over machine learning applications in Python.
It supports PyTorch to allow for easier integration of TorchQL queries into the machine learning pipeline.
Users can write queries that specify integrity constraints through a combination of query operations and arbitrary
user-defined functions.
These integrity constraints can then be directly evaluated over models and datasets.

Explore TorchQL
---------------

You can get started by exploring TorchQL and its features over the iWildCam Dataset through our Google Colab Notebook `Demo
<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dXsyx20GK6OXuRsQzwANlZzu_0mFqtrZ>`_,
which does not require any local installation.


Quick Start
-----------

To get started with TorchQL locally, check out the :doc:`quickstart` guide.
